# react-flux

Web application built using Node.js, Gulp, eslint, Browserify, React, React Router, and Redux.

Followed a pluralsight course excluding the code related to course management. That code was a part of the final challenge and written completly by me based on what was previously covered.

To view and run the application:
  1) Clone the repo
  2) Cd into cloned repo and run npm install
  3) In the command prompt/terminal type gulp
  
  A window in your default browser should open to the font page of the application
